# DOOBNet: Deep Object Occlusion Boundary Detection from an Image ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03772))

Created by Guoxia Wang.

### Introduction

Object occlusion boundary detection is a fundamental and crucial research problem in computer vision. This is challenging to solve as encountering the extreme boundary/non-boundary class imbalance during training an object occlusion boundary detector. In this paper, we propose to address this class imbalance by up-weighting the loss contribution of false negative and false positive examples with our novel Attention Loss function. We also propose a unified end-to-end multi-task deep object occlusion boundary detection network (DOOBNet) by sharing convolutional features to simultaneously predict object boundary and occlusion orientation. DOOBNet adopts an encoder-decoder structure with skip connection in order to automatically learn multi-scale and multi-level features. We significantly surpass the state-of-the-art on the PIOD dataset (ODS F-score of .668) and the BSDS ownership dataset (ODS F-score of .555), as well as improving the detecting speed to as 0.037s per image.

## Training

Source code will be released coming soon.

### Data Preparation

Here, we assume that you locate in the DOOBNet root directory `$DOOBNET_ROOT`.

#### PASCAL Instance Occlusion Dataset (PIOD)

You may download the dataset original images from [PASCAL VOC 2010](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2010/VOCtrainval_03-May-2010.tar) and annotations from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7DaWBKShuMBSkZ6Mm5RVmg5ck0/view?usp=sharing). Then you should copy or move `JPEGImages` folder in PASCAL VOC 2010 and `Data` folder and val\_doc_2010.txt in PIOD to `data/PIOD/`. You will have the following directory structure:
```
PIOD
|_ Data
|  |_ <id-1>.mat
|  |_ ...
|  |_ <id-n>.mat
|_ JPEGImages 
|  |_ <id-1>.jpg
|  |_ ...
|  |_ <id-n>.jpg
|_ val_doc_2010.txt
```

Now, you can use data convert tool to augment and generate HDF5 format data for DOOBNet. 
```
mkdir data/PIOD/Augmentation

python tools/doobnet_mat2hdf5_edge_ori.py \
--dataset PIOD \
--label-dir data/PIOD/Data \
--img-dir data/PIOD/JPEGImages \
--piod-val-list-file data/PIOD/val_doc_2010.txt \ 
--output-dir data/PIOD/Augmentation
```

#### BSDS ownership

For BSDS ownership dataset, you may download the dataset original images from [BSDS300](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/segbench/BSDS300-images.tgz) and annotations from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7DaWBKShuMBd3Z0Vmk3UkZxcUU). Then you should copy or move `BSDS300` folder in BSDS300-images and `trainfg` and `testfg` folder in BSDS\_theta to `data/BSDSownership/`. And you will have the following directory structure:
```
BSDSownership
|_ trainfg
|  |_ <id-1>.mat
|  |_ ...
|  |_ <id-n>.mat
|_ testfg
|  |_ <id-1>.mat
|  |_ ...
|  |_ <id-n>.mat
|_ BSDS300
|  |_ images
|     |_ train
|        |_ <id-1>.jpg
|        |_ ...
|        |_ <id-n>.jpg
|     |_ ...
|  |_ ...
```
Note that BSDS ownership's test set are split from 200 train images (100 for train, 100 for test). More information you can check ids in `trainfg` and `testfg` folder and ids in `BSDS300/images/train` folder, or refer to [here](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/fg/fgdata.tar.gz)

Run the following code for BSDS ownership dataset. 
```
mkdir data/BSDSownership/Augmentation

python tools/doobnet_mat2hdf5_edge_ori.py \
--dataset BSDSownership \
--label-dir data/BSDSownership/trainfg \
--img-dir data/BSDSownership/BSDS300/images/train \
--bsdsownership-testfg data/BSDSownership/testfg \
--output-dir data/BSDSownership/Augmentation 
```
